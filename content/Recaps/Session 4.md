[[Session 3]]
Finishing combat with the Flame Skull

Xan reads the note:
"Hey It's [[H]]. Got a couple of jars of [[Kemh]] finally. He should be safe out here in Jackalope. Had to ice a nosy wizard though."

[[Feywild Fire Brandy]] (empty)

Two skeleton parts lying (missing skulls) in a locked room in [[Haymish]]'s house.

We enter the final chamber of the basement to find a room filled with sand. It has horrible necromantic energy, but is sunny, warm, and looks like a nice place despite the rancid vibes.

Drexx and Aurelia begin digging in the sand in the location that some jars Bug sensed in the ground.

Bug casts Identify on the Jars, and knows they are [[Canopic Jar]]s they are used in the mummification process. They had a lung and a liver in them. Typically powerful mummies have their organs stored in these jars, if theyre killed, as long as some amount of their organs are in existence they can still regenerate.

After looting we exit Haymishes basement, we find a scene of horror, [[Bumbersnatch (Driver)]] is dead, [[Draven]] is severly injured. We see [[Raven]] being held at knifepoint by a human.  

Bumbersnatch after learning we destroyed the mummy parts, shoots [[Burt Sanddigger]] and snaps his own neck. Burt has a 'DNR' tattoo which says 'DNR if its tomorrow'

After 'vanquishing a source of evil' we get a call from [[Pashem]] who is a hero analyst. Asking if we'll return to [[Cradle]] 

We get signed up for [[JibJob]]. A questing board for adventurers 

The gang learns that aurelia doesn't have a shadow.

Ball Sack shows the party that we have the silk root from the Candy Co.

We get invited to [[Zavistic]]'s Pot luck after he makes a wonderful [[hot sauce scramble]] in the Jackalope way.
