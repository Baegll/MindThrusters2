[[Session 4]]
We go to the top of the [[Wizards Guild]] above the cloudline because of [[Zavistic]] teleporting us up to the pot luck. Space needle esque.

Huge table dedicated to dragon ribs, chocolate fountain, very bougie, little stand with hot sauce scramble (long line) musicians

LOTS of character moments in rapid fire

Findus gets his phone upgraded by [[Page]]

Party rages on

Cart gets stolen by [[Zendus Brimhaven (Attractive Driver)]], he ends up dying. [[The Crew]] gets attacked by a Black Ooze which reanimates two horses.

[[Beagorug (Bug)]] takes a good inspection at some of the parties items to have a poormens find person

[[Sgt. Fuzzytail]] commander of the finest nut distribution this side of Cradle. 

We learned that [[Zendus Brimhaven (Attractive Driver)]] was swinging tree to tree like a monkey on his way to [[Cradle]] after crashing his cart.

In a place far away we dont know.

There is a tattered cloak, a burned bald head hunched forward with their hands on a table. Across from them, there is a figure shrouded in darkness with a head made of flame.

"Right well, theres been an update. Twice this group of shitheads has foiled me." -Masked
"Deal with them, or I deal with you" -Flame Skull
