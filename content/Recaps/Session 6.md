Female Dragonborn Lady who handed out our quest and the tablet to [[Beagorug (Bug)]]. Greets us on our return to [[Cradle]]

Theres a [[Runic Processing Chamber]] on the enterance to [[Cradle]]. which scans for demonic, otherworldly and extraplanar entities attached to characters.

We enter [[Cradle]] for the first time! Massive Metropolis where theres lots of people, shit tons of people. Lots of people in magic gear.

We part ways with [[Gogus]], [[Draven]], and [[Raven]].

We head to [[Miracle Ward]] to find the [[Silver Talon Riding Club]] to get a place to stay by fencing the [[Silk Root]]. [[Ball Sack]] talks to [[Binty]] who refers us to [[Vic Ethanol]] upstairs. They let us stay one night for the drugs.

We head to [[Cradle Adventurers Agency (CAA)]] first, I think we're looking for [[Beagorug (Bug)]] friend [[Oskja 'farsight']].

We learn about [[CCL (Cradle Clout Level)]], and realize we're fucking low level idiots still.

We enter [[Bifsonian Center for Culture and History]] and [[Aurelia]] pays for everyone to enter (2cp/person (very cheap))

Findus is stricken looking at a picture titled [[The Subjugation of Guy Town]].

[[Wade Westpaw]] maybe W.W. who died in service to [[Cradle]]? [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]] ?

We also go to archeology section to find details on the mummy lord [[Kemh]]

Technology section has an extremely old painting labelled [[Construction Wall Assembly Team]]

We then go to [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]]. We then meet [[Wyatt Westpaw]]! Wishes he could've been here in person. But hes in [[Avernus]]! Tells us we can stay on the second floor of [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]] until its demolished. [[Wade Westpaw]] used to live here, didnt have many beds.

[[Wyatt Westpaw]] tells us to go to [[Cradle General Hospital]] and [[Deckard]] will give us a pick of some item from the shop.

We split the party.
