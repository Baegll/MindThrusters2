[[Session 2]]

On our way to [[Good Knight's Rest]] we pass a [[Candy Co]] and [[Ball Sack]] and [[Xanavaika]] peek and "see a dufflebag of drugs" 

[[Ball Sack]] did a performance the night we got there, light show assist by [[Xanavaika]]. They perform a whole set list. and earn a whole 6 gold!

Found the Sheriff [[Dantes]] with 2 deputies. Takes a look at the hand, drops the hand in a pitcher of beer. Told me to go to the [[Wizards Guild]].

[[Ball Sack]] and [[Xanavaika]] go to steal from the [[Candy Co]]. [[Ball Sack]] disguises as his dad. They successfully steal the drugs which turn out to be [[Silk Root]] (100s of gold worth)

We learn that the [[Wizards Guild]] is about 30 minutes away.

The drugs get stashed in a secret compartment under the cart.

The hand was [[Clarence]]'s an apprentice. We were asked to investigate the office of [[Burts Sand Farm]] to find [[Burt Sanddigger]]'s actual hours. 

We acquire a 'warrant' bar napkin of entry signed by [[Dantes]] to enter Haymishes office. We split into two groups to have an entry team and a distraction team.

We break into Haymishes office and find one note which reads:

We go down to the basement under the office, immediately stench of death and undead flood our senses. A Flameskull attacks us with a fireball, dealing 23 damage, which takes down Draven immediately.
