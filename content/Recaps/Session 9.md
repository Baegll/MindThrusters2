[[Session 8]]

We're in the [[Feywild]]!

We come up with code names:
Aurelia is Ainsel
Findus is Secreteriat
Xan is Bass
Ball Sack is Bug 3
Drexx is Crazy Frog
Bug is Smut Lover 420
0TT0 is Darby the Bot
Ambrose is Groundhog

Some notable locations in [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]]-
[[Spinnyville]]
West/West-Southwest is a forest that is [[Twilight Forest]]
South of [[Twilight Forest]] is a little settlement, named [[Shadybrook]]
Big central hub - [[Food Court]]

me flavored water guy selling 'me flavored water' from his barrel of water. Findus drinks it- gross

Findus gets a lead from barrel gnome 

Ball Sack and Findus play a whack-a-gnoll game. 
Findus wins a hammer/mallet thingy!

Its a +1 mace that does extra damage to things that feast on flesh and blood.

We pass through [[Food Court]] and see that its essentially been picked clean, and that there was a strong presence of [[ThrustCola]] 

We run into someone who knows [[Ball Sack]] named [[Wall Sack]] who used to guard [[Nomaria]]. Looks like the whole clan was just named Sack. 

You can't leave [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]] until you have a ticket. Last person to leave was [[Sylwarin]] 

We make it to [[ShadyBrook]]. Theres some [[Harengon]] here.

[[Ambrose]] is a reporter for the [[Voice of Cradle]]. Says we're in a time loop essentially!?!??
In [[Gruncle Dadd's Manor]] there are details of a teleportation ritual which shows how he brought [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]] to the [[Feywild]]. 

A lot of the powerful vampires are out of their HQ apparently? 

Told us to talk to [[Wanda Westpaw]]

The Blue Dragon that caused the Mass Casualty Event at the [[Cradle General Hospital]] also may have happened to [[Nomaria]] and [[Wall Sack]].

We meet and talk to a tortle cleric named [[Sheldon]] and his younger emo brother [[Young Sheldon 'Night Angel']].  Theyve been here since before it got taken to the feywild.

We talk to [[Wanda Westpaw]], shes been here at least 3 months. Asked about [[Wade Westpaw]].

Okay theres a couple threads to get out of [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]]. Either go to [[Twilight Forest]] and find the ticket printer, or go to [[Gruncle Dadd's Manor]] and reverse the ritual to return [[Fantanimaland]] back to the material plane.

We enter the twilight forest.
Findus is the first to enter (and be challenged) - fails
I am the next - I fail
0TT0 is next - fails
Ball Sack is next - fails, and owes a satyr with a golden harp a favor
Xan is next - succeeds.

We're trying to start break into the Manor. Ball Sack falls through the window, and activates the quirky enchanted armor automatons.
