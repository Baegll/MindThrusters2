COMBAT at the top of the session!

[[Sylwarin]] runs away like a bitch and turns into a bat.

In Sylwarin's bag is a chalice, and old timey ticket to [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]], and 20gp

[[Wyatt Westpaw]] did not have an ideal outcome in his battle so they fell back. 
Wyatt asks us to find [[Wade Westpaw]]'s wife and kids.
We can't see [[Pewter]] through the portal.

[[Detective Van]] walks in and starts investigating. 

"back when [[Cradle]] was more open to others" - [[Detective Van]]
[[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]] has a rumor of Crazy Wizard birthday party went awry destroyed it. Or the initial run of animatronics from [[Elegy Automatons Corporate Office]] exploded.

we get harassed by a fucking kid?? [[Brent]]

[[Delios's Discount Rugs]] flying carpet shop?

We get to ride a carpet for free (if we advertise) so we go East of [[Cradle]] in the general direction of [[Gruncle Dadd's Fantanimaland]]

We find the knife in the forest with no [[Detective Van]].

We find a portal to the [[Feywild]], Findus goes first, the rest of the party follows shortly after.

At the base of our flying carpet, a projection shows:

An old gentleman reading a book, and pleasant music plays. A squirrel walks up holnding a tray of cookies. "well hey there [[Smaggy Squirrel]]" "I just wanted to bring you some cookies" "We've got a couple of visitors, I'm [[Gruncle Dadd]], and welcome to [[Fantanimaland]]". "You've got both of our names, ain't that nice." "welcome to Fantanimaland, we've got a couple of JibJobbers here" 

[[JibJob]] board:

| 20 Gold          | An old ride in [[Spinnyville]] awakened and ate some people. It now attacks anything that comes near that area and cackles menacingly. [[Glim]] just want [[Glim]]'s wrench back.                                                                           |

| 15 Gold          | The carousel's enchantment went out. I honestly don't care because it's ANNOYING AS FUCK, but the music kept the dryads out of the park. Deal with it or don't, like I mentioned earlier in this posting I don't care.                                      |
| 40 Gold          | Popcorn elemental??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35 Gold          | Hello? Are there any JibJobbers in this gods-forsaken place? There's been a string of kidnappings out in [[Shadybrook]]. We're barely holding it together as is, and I can't pay much, but we've scraped together what we still had on us for this request. |
| 2 Gold           | hi my [[doggy chuckleburp]] is missing please please find him                                                                                                                                                                                               |
