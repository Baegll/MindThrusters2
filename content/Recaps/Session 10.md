[[Session 9]]

Bug sees [[MER]] when entering the [[Twilight Forest]]. [[Davos Alonmore]] presents an incredibly gaslighty and crude presentation on emotional intelligence. Guilts [[Beagorug (Bug)]], fills out the form and fails the save.

Drexx is sitting in a cart, sitting across from a villager who was his first kiss. A voice challenges Drex to a game of chance. 

Bug spider climbs up to the window with Findus' rope, opens the window with Knock and Ball Sack casted Silence

An old-ass halfing with the code name 'Scott' comes across the party. Their real name is actually [[Scoochiticus Boochiticus Maximus I]]. Their trial has them breaking out of a prison I think?? They see their son, eat a wonderful chocolate pudding cup, and then leave the scene to run across the party. [[Fizzlewink]]

We make our way inside, theres a desk, an animatronic [[Smaggy Squirrel]] with a greatsword. 

We've stolen some [[Gruncle Dadd]] documents

These documents have Archfey names!?
Had a business within [[Fantanimaland]]:
- [[Velantra of the Mirrorveil]]
- [[Thrungledown Bim]]
- [[Queen Marrowbliss]]
- [[Lady Cinderglim of the Shadow Court]]
- [[Nibblegrin]] - Handling all of the [[ThrustCola]] here.
- [[Lord Vandross]]

Lots of coded messaging for how these Archfey brought [[Fantanimaland]] to the [[Feywild]]. Seems like [[Gruncle Dadd]] was complicit in this act.

We meet [[Bigby]] and [[Redd]] who are Werewolves. They mark [[0TT0]] with scentt, and then leave after some kind words.

[[Ambrose]] also left for [[ShadyBrook]].

Bug gets a ping on the [[Detective Van]]'s badge, so we head deeper into the forest.

I GO ON MY DATE, SO I LEAVE HERE, no more notes.
