#HideThis 

Group 2 is at [[Plugg's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut]]

[[Ball Sack]] buys a [[Toe-Ring of Pointing]] from [[Plugg's Butt-Ugly Stuff Hut]] and Ball sack needs to advertise the shop in return.

Theres a lot of people carrying around canned drinks with them [[ThrustCola]] of course, and a green can drink [[PLOTARMR]]. 

Aurelia is in [[Cradle General Hospital]]. [[Drexajuuk]] and [[Findus]] leave to meet up with [[Beagorug (Bug)]] at [[The Vinebrary]]

Nurse named [[Gray]], doesn't know off-hand, but points me to the records room.

Finds [[Wade Westpaw Medical Record]], makes a copy of it and heads back to [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]].

[[Beagorug (Bug)]] heads inside [[The Vinebrary]]. Gets a lil horny with the vine that put her at a history book. The history book has content on greater mummy lords in [[Sunh'olon]] [[Ephemeral Greater Mummies]] there is a page on [[Kemh]]. This mummy does not have a jaw. Kemh was an all-powerful mummy lord from centuries past, was defeated, returned, defeated again. (returned again to kill us probably)

[[Findus]] asks for smut from [[The Vinebrary]]. [[Beagorug (Bug)]] also asks for smut. [[Drexajuuk]] asks for info about protecting the [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]] from being demolished.

They also got library cards, and a few law books.

Cradle Clout Level is a thing

We tell [[Wyatt Westpaw]] about his brothers status, we get magic items!

[[Sylwarin]] comes to [[Westpaw's Wondrous Wares]] and knocks on our door. I like a dumbass let him in in the midst of my [[A Ceremony of Blessing (Drawing)]]. I get stabbed in the back, and am unconscious making death saves. Instantly a bunch of vampire spawns burst through the windows and attack us.

I instantly use the fucking creepy doll to stabilize myself from combat. I see an image of [[Cassian Aria]] at a wonderful rustic home, children running around, one says 'momma, its not time yet' and I feel a dagger sink into the creepy doll and I come back to life on the floor.
