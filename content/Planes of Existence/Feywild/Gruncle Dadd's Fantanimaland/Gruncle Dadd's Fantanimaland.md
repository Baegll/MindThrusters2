JibJob board when we first got there:

| 20 Gold          | An old ride in [[Spinnyville]] awakened and ate some people. It now attacks anything that comes near that area and cackles menacingly. [[Glim]] just want [[Glim]]'s wrench back.                                                                           |

| 15 Gold          | The carousel's enchantment went out. I honestly don't care because it's ANNOYING AS FUCK, but the music kept the dryads out of the park. Deal with it or don't, like I mentioned earlier in this posting I don't care.                                      |
| 40 Gold          | Popcorn elemental??                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 35 Gold          | Hello? Are there any JibJobbers in this gods-forsaken place? There's been a string of kidnappings out in [[Shadybrook]]. We're barely holding it together as is, and I can't pay much, but we've scraped together what we still had on us for this request. |
| 2 Gold           | hi my [[doggy chuckleburp]] is missing please please find him                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| No Reward Listed | This request is only for the [[Mind Goblins]]. Need you guys to get to me ASAP. Time is of the essence. Can't say who I am but I know you.                                                                                                                  |
