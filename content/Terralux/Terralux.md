Terra Lux is the name of our planet.

[[Sunh'olon]] is a continent on the planet, which we started playing on.

Terra Lux is a habitable planet formed an unknowable amount of time ago, with two celestial bodies: [[Patia]] & [[Zel]].

Ages past have seen great wars fought between the gods of the material plane on Terra Lux. These battles permanently scarred the planet, leaving indescribably large chasms scraped into various areas of the world's surface- referred to by most cultures as "[[Godstrenches]]". There are currently 6 known **"GTs"**, each referred to academically as GT-1 through GT-6.
