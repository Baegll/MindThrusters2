Cascading across the eastern reaches of Cradle's territory is the fantastical _**Sunmet Quarter**_. Consisting of extravagant skyscrapers and ostentatious architectural designs, the _**Sunmet Quarter**_ is the region of Cradle where the major corporations and brands with a presence in Cradle set up shop.

Heroes of Cradle come to the _**Sunmet Quarter**_ for any number of services. Here they can find various hero-run law firms, to defend them in litigations due to their actions on the job, or agencies to represent them as heroes-for-hire on a global scale. They can find the corporate offices of various organizations within the realm, and the very headquarters of Cradle Guard itself. Most importantly, heroes often visit the _**Sunmet Quarter**_ to make withdrawals or deposits at [[Fortune's Reach - Cradle Branch]], the largest bank operated exclusively by- and for- heroes of Cradle.
