At the center of the district stands the majestic _Eternal Flame Temple_, a colossal structure dedicated to the most revered and ancient gods of the multiverse. Its great golden spire reaches into the sky like a beacon of divine light. Here, priests and acolytes of various orders offer their services to those who seek guidance, and travelers from across the world come to pray for favor and blessings. The Eternal Flame is said to be blessed by _[[Ao]]_, the Overgod, whose will is carried through the actions of his chosen mortals.
