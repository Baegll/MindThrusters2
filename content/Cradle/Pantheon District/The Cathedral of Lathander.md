The _Cathedral of Lathander_ shines like a sunrise at the western end of the Pantheon District, an expansive and radiant structure dedicated to _[[Lathander]]_, the Morninglord, god of renewal, creativity, and vitality. His temple glows with golden light, and each morning, the first rays of sunlight cast a warm glow over its towering spires. Those who seek hope, creativity, and inspiration come here, where Lathander’s followers offer their blessings, whether for a new beginning, a creative pursuit, or a chance at personal renewal.
