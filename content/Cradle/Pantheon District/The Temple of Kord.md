In the southern corner of the district, the _Temple of Kord_ stands as a tribute to the God of Storms, Strength, and Battle. His temple is a place of vigorous activity, where heroes train, spar, and partake in great feats of strength and endurance. Devotees of [[Kord]], many of them barbarian warriors and gladiators, gather here to prove their mettle and to receive blessings for their next trial or battle. The halls echo with the sounds of laughter, clashing swords, and the booming voice of Kord himself, inspiring his champions to great heights of power.
