To the east of the Pantheon District stands the towering temple ofÂ _[[Bahamut]]_, the Platinum Dragon. His temple is a gleaming bastion of law, justice, and protection, with high walls of shimmering silver and gates of adamantine that glow with divine light. His followers, paladins and clerics, patrol the city, ensuring that the laws of the gods are upheld, and they offer their aid to any who are in need of protection. In the heart of the temple is an immense statue of Bahamut, wings spread wide in a gesture of eternal vigilance.
