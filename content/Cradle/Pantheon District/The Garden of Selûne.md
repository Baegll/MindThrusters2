Adjacent to Kord's temple, the _Garden of Selûne_ offers a peaceful respite from the city’s bustle. This serene sanctuary is dedicated to _[[Selûne]]_, the Moon Goddess, and serves as a place of reflection and inner peace. Moonlit pools and silvered trees surround the temple, and here, travelers come to seek solace, to meditate, and to commune with the cycles of the moon and the stars. Her followers—who often include druids and mystics—believe in balance, healing, and the eternal connection between the celestial and the earthly realms.
