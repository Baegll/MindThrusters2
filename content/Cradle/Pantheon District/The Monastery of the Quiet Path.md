Finally, nestled within the furthest corner of the district is the humble _Monastery of the Quiet Path_, dedicated to the god _[[Ilmater]]_, the God of Endurance and Suffering. His followers, monks, and healers dedicate themselves to offering relief to those in pain, in body and in spirit. The monastery’s peaceful grounds serve as a retreat for those burdened by hardship, offering both physical and emotional healing through self-discipline and compassion.
