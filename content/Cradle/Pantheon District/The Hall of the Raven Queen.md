Nearby, the grand _Hall of the Raven Queen_ towers above the streets. This somber yet magnificent temple is dedicated to _[[The Raven Queen]]_, goddess of death and fate. A dark, almost ethereal energy hums in the air around her followers, who come to pay tribute to the cycle of life and death. Her devoted priests often offer counsel to those seeking answers about their destinies, while her champions stand ever vigilant against the encroaching forces of the [[Shadowfell]].
