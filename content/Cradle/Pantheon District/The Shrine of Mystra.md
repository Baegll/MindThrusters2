Not far from Bahamut’s temple, the _Shrine of Mystra_ hums with arcane power. _[[Mystra]]_, the Goddess of Magic, has a profound presence here, and her followers guard the flow of magic with a devotion that matches her own. The Shrine serves as a haven for wizards, sorcerers, and other magic users who seek to hone their craft or gain divine insight into the secrets of the weave. A portal to the [[Astral Plane]], where the Weave is said to originate, is said to reside within the temple, hidden from mortal sight by only the most dedicated of Mystra’s followers.
