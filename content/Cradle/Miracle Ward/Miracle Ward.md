Nestled along the western bank of Cradle's interior lies the city's hub for commerce and trade: the _**Miracle Ward**_. This district pulses with life—packed with vibrant stalls, grand bazaars, and luxurious merchant halls. The streets are paved with smooth marble tiles, etched with symbols of the gods of commerce and luck, representing the divine influence that guides all transactions here. The air is rich with the scent of exotic spices, fine leather, and freshly baked foods from cultures all across the realms. The sound of bartering voices and ringing coins fills the air.

In the _**Miracle Ward**_, commerce is not just a way of life; it’s an extension of heroism. Each merchant, craftsman, and service provider here carries the weight of their own legendary deeds. Whether they forged their reputation in battle, discovered lost treasures, or outwitted a god, each business is a symbol of valor, strength, and accomplishment. The city’s elite and adventurers alike come here to trade rare goods, share tales of their exploits, and seek out the extraordinary.
