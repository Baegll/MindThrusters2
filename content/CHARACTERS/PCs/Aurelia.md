## Story Beats
When I picked up the [[Feywild Fire Brandy]], a vision sends me to see a massive translucent stork. Kneeling in front of the stork is a 2 year younger Aurelia. I reach for my sword, its not there. I am just a shadow. When I make a move the stork looks at me in the vision and states. 'Curious, youre not needed here little [[Seabird]], fly home.' I get blown away and get sent back to *reality*.



## External Descriptors

Aurelia stands tall and carries herself with the confidence of nobility. Her green eyes, flecked with gold, gleam with an intense gaze, the colors often reminding those who see her of druidic magic, or the feywild. Her blonde hair, nearly golden under the right light, is kept either in elegant braids, or let loose to flow about her shoulders. Her pale skin adds to her ethereal presence. And yet, for all her radiance, something about her is unsettling to those who look closely–her shadow is absent, a telltale sign of a bargain struck and lost.

Her attire is both practical and refined. Beneath a well-traveled cloak she wears studded leather armor, its darkened leather panels embossed with delicate, curling vine patterns. Small metallic rivets catch the light, subtly reflecting forest greens, bronze autumn leaves, and silver like moonlight. The travelling cloak itself is a deep forest green, lined with a pale silky interior. When the wind catches it, and the sunlight strikes through, thick vines with blooming flowers can be seen embroidered into it.

At her left hip sits a sidesword, a swept hilt of iron branches protecting her hand, made of darkened steel. Her buckler on the right hip is small, but has enough space for her holy symbol, a carving of an ancient twisting tree with roots that spiral outward in an endless interwoven pattern. Both the swept hilt of the sidesword and the tree embossed on the buckler glow faintly the same hues as the rivets in her armor, soft greens, bronzes and faintly silver. In addition to her primary weapons, a simple dagger rests near her stomach stuck in her belt comfortably. Attached to her right leg is a handaxe, the simple blade facing behind her, so she might quickly rip it from her leg and throw it at a running target.

A satchel clinks under her buckler, full of alchemical wares, glass vials full of shimmering liquids of varying hues. A small backpack with many pockets smells fragrantly of different flowers, mushrooms, herbs, and even various parts of creatures. A hidden coin purse sits on her hip with her sword, reminding her of the power that can come from wealth.

## Backstory

Aurelia Lunis was born on the mist-laden shores of a forgotten peninsula, where the sea met dense, ancient forests, and the line between the material world and the Feywild blurred. The Lunis family was once of noble blood, but generations of misfortune had faded their name into obscurity.

Her childhood was filled with the teachings of both steel and craft. Her father, a once-proud knight turned wandering sellsword, taught her the art of the blade. At the same time, her mother, a master alchemist, imparted the delicate knowledge of transmutation, healing, and deception. A potion could be as powerful as a sword if sold with the right words. Despite their dwindling fortunes, they raised her to carry herself with the confidence of a ruler, instilling in her the belief that power is not just taken, it is perceived. 

Despite her upbringing, Aurelia never sought wealth or grandeur in her early years. Choosing to settle down with [[Cassian Aria]], a quiet but loving man who worked as a carpenter. Their life together was humble, but honorable.  
  
They lived in a small cottage at the edge of town, where Aurelia spent her days tending to a modest garden, selling salves and tinctures to locals and travelers. It was not a grand life, certainly not the noble life her family once had, but it was hers. Evenings were spent by the fire, laughter in the air as they played card and dice games, dreaming of the children they would one day have. Cassian would trace patterns on her palm, sketches of the grand home he promised to build for them someday. She would tease him for dreaming so big when all they ever wanted was here in the home they already built.

Aurelia had always been drawn to the strange places where the mist thickened, where the light caught the dew on the leaves just so, where the veil between worlds seemed thinner. In one such place, on the eve of her twenty-first birthday, she met the [[Archfey]].

The details of the encounter are hazy even to her. A game was played—a riddle woven in the stars, a test of wit and will. The stakes were unclear at first, masked in layers of Fey trickery, but she remembers the feeling of victory being so close, just within her grasp. And then... she lost.

Her shadow was taken, pulled from her like breath from lungs, leaving behind a strange absence that others could not always name but always felt. The Archfey, amused and enigmatic, left her with nothing but a whisper:

"The game is not over, little light. Win it back, if you can."

Two weeks later, she returned home. Only to find that a year had passed in the material world. Her husband, the man she had loved with the same fire she now reserved for vengeance, had grieved her loss and moved on. She was a ghost to him, a wound already healed. The life she had known had slipped through her fingers like sand.

She did not break, though the weight of her loss was immense. Instead, she reforged herself. If the fey had stolen from her, she would one day steal back.

She took the more regal name Aurelia au Lunaria, a title that carried the echoes of nobility, though no official bloodline claimed her. She embraced the art of deception—not out of malice, but out of necessity. Her silver tongue became her weapon just as much as her sidesword and buckler. With carefully crafted potions, dressed in finery just convincing enough, she wove a new identity: the traveling noblewoman, the alchemist of rare and exotic wares, the paladin who stood between the light and the dark.

But beneath the careful mask, her true mission never wavered. She would find a way to reclaim her shadow. She would grow in power, in wealth, in influence, until no Archfey could ever claim dominion over her fate again.

The game was not over.

It had only just begun.
