## Story Beats I'd like to start up
- [ ] Scene of quiet prayer in [[The Garden of Sel√ªne]].
- [ ] Scene where I perform a Ceremony of protection on [[The Crew]].
* In depth description of the ritual I take them through
	* details...
* Ask DM if we could get some sort of benefit maybe, but totally acceptable with no benefit. Would be a nice RP moment
- [ ] Scene where I inform the party of my plan of war with the [[Archfey]].
* Something about gaining power to fight the Archfey? idk not super set on a plan, but eventually if I have one this would be nice
- [ ] Scene where I inform the party about the [[Stork]]/[[Archfey]]. As well as why I am a Paladin
- Bring up my goddess [[Chauntea]] the earthmother.
- Initial worship to her as part of trying to conceive a child with [[Cassian Aria]]
- In my prayers I would often sit out on the pier, feeling the quiet crash of waves on the shore I was very familiar with [[Stork]]s in mythology, and carved a [[Wooden Stork]] as an amulet in devotion to Chauntea to help me bear a child.
- One day while searching for herbs in the local forest, I fell into a portal to the Feywild. Initially I thought I was lucky, as I found myself in a beautiful clearing. After some time the first creature I met was a giant Stork. I thought my prayers were going to be answered. After an introduction, the stork asked me to play a game. The Bluffing Game. I won initially, and we began wagering things. I, of course, wanted to conceive a child with my husband. The stork wanted my shadow. I lost of course. That bastard could see how easily I was fooled. I felt my shadow ripped away and told that Stork I would find and kill him. Then, the [[Archfey]] revealed its true nature. He told me it got what it wanted, and offered me a way back to the world on one condition. I would become its paladin. With a lack of options and a brewing plan for revenge I accepted.

- [ ] Scene where [[Aurelia]] apologizes to [[Ball Sack]] for forcing him to return the gold to [[Zendus Brimhaven (Attractive Driver)]].
"I'd like to apologize Ball, I.. I didnt realize Zendus was, some sort of evil creature. I can't allow you to steal from the innocent, especially someone who needs protection. Thats one of the reasons I stole from [[Haymish]] in the basement, those flaming skulls were a sign of his evil. That brick of drugs you took I have no issue with, while I dont approve of you fencing them to someone, or even really partaking yourself. The person who had that brick in the first place was harming others, and so I won't become some self-righteous paladin on you for stealing."

- [ ] Scene with [[Findus]] about fatherhood.
- Maybe go to [[Guy Town]] with Findus??
- [ ] Scene with [[Beagorug (Bug)]] about being divorced.
