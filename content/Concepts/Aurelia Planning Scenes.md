## Intra-Party

- [ ] Scene where I perform a Ceremony of protection on [[Mind Goblins]].
* In depth description of the ritual I take them through
	* details...
* Ask DM if we could get some sort of benefit maybe, but totally acceptable with no benefit. Primarily want it to be a nice RP moment
- [x] Scene where I inform the party of my plan of war with the [[Archfey]].
* Something about gaining power to fight the Archfey? idk not super set on a plan, but eventually if I have one this would be nice
- [ ] Scene where I inform the party about the [[Stork]]/[[Archfey]]. As well as why I am a Paladin
- [ ] Bring up my goddess [[Chauntea]] the earthmother.
- [ ] Initial worship to her as part of trying to conceive a child with [[Cassian Aria]]
- [ ] In my prayers I would often sit out on the pier, feeling the quiet crash of waves on the shore I was very familiar with [[Stork]]s in mythology, and carved a [[Wooden Stork]] as an amulet in devotion to Chauntea to help me bear a child.
- [x] One day while searching for herbs in the local forest, I fell into a portal to the [[Feywild]]. Initially I thought I was lucky, as I found myself in a beautiful clearing. After some time the first creature I met was a giant Stork. I thought my prayers were going to be answered. After an introduction, the stork asked me to play a game. [[The Bluffing Game]]. I won initially, and we began wagering things. I, of course, wanted to conceive a child with my husband. The stork wanted my shadow. I lost of course. That bastard could see how easily I was fooled. I felt my shadow ripped away and told that Stork I would find and kill him. Then, the [[Archfey]] revealed its true nature. He told me it got what it wanted, and offered me a way back to the world on one condition. I would become its paladin. With a lack of options and a brewing plan for revenge I accepted.

- [x] Scene where Aurelia apologizes to Ball Sack for forcing him to return the gold to Zendus Brimhaven (Attractive Driver).
	- [x] "I'd like to apologize Ball, I.. I didnt realize Zendus was, some sort of evil creature. I can't allow you to steal from the innocent, especially someone who needs protection. Thats one of the reasons I stole from Haymish in the basement, those flaming skulls were a sign of his evil. That brick of drugs you took I have no issue with, while I dont approve of you fencing them to someone, or even really partaking yourself. The person who had that brick in the first place was harming others, and so I won't become some self-righteous paladin on you for stealing."

- [ ] Scene with [[Findus]] about fatherhood.
- Maybe go to [[Guy Town]] with Findus??
- [ ] Scene with [[Beagorug (Bug)]] about being divorced.
- [x] 'holy shit I need your help, I cant die like this I need to kill an archfey and get my shadow back.. I saw, Cassian, when I hit the ground there, none of you know him, but he is my husband.. was, I guess yada yada yada'
