## Story Beats I'd like to start up

- [ ] Scene where I inform the party about the [[Stork]].

- [ ] Scene where [[Aurelia]] apologizes to [[Ball Sack]] for forcing him to return the gold to [[Zendus Brimhaven (Attractive Driver)]].
"I'd like to apologize Ball, I.. I didnt realize Zendus was, some sort of evil creature. I can't allow you to steal from the innocent, especially someone who needs protection. Thats one of the reasons I stole from [[Haymish]] in the basement, those flaming skulls were a sign of his evil. That brick of drugs you took I have no issue with, while I dont approve of you fencing them to someone, or even really partaking yourself. The person who had that brick in the first place was harming others, and so I won't become some self-righteous paladin on you for stealing."
